        <h1>I. Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Problem identification</h2>
        <p>There has been a lack of research on Co3+ complexes incorporating reduced Schiff base (RSB) ligands. </p><p>Hence, this project aims to fill the gap in information for the research in Cobalt (III) Complexes incoporating amino acid reduced schiff bases.</p>

              <h3>Cobalt</h3>
              <p>Cobalt complexes can undergo selective transitions between +2 and +3 oxidation state and contain certain redox properties unobserved in other transition metal species.</p>
              <p>It has also been shown to be compatible with the human body as seen in the case of naturally occuring Cobalamin (Vitamin B-12)</p>

          <h3>Past Researches</h3>
          <p>Copper(II), Manganese(II) and Iron(III) reduced Schiff base complexes have displayed considerable catecholase activity (Lu, Song, Hui & Zhang 2012) (Yang, Vetrichelvan, Yang, Moubaraki, Murray & Vittal 2003)</p>
          <p>Vanadium Oxide(II) reduced Schiff base complexes have been shown to be better in standards as compared to commercially available bacteria and fungicides (Mangamamba, Garnorkar & Swarnabala 2014)</p>

        <p>Hence, our solution to the problem is to successfully synthesise Co3+ complexes incorporating reduced Schiff base ligands in order to characterise and study these complexes and their properties</p>
        <h2>Starting Materials</h2>
        <h3>Synthesis of [Co(NH3)4CO3]NO3</h3>
          <p>A solution containing 7.496 g of [Co(OH2)6](NO3)2 dissolved in 15.0 cm3 of H2O was added to a solution, under constant stirring, containing 9.984 g of (NH4)2CO3 dissolved in 30.0 cm3 of H2O and 40.0 cm3 of 25% aqueous NH3. 20.0 cm3 of 6% H2O2 solution was added dropwise to the solution. The solution was concentrated to around 80 cm3 using temperatures no greater than 80.0 ℃ with a total of 2.50 g of (NH4)2CO3 being added in small portions to the solution at 15 min intervals. The solution was left overnight in a refrigerator to crystallise and then suction filtered. Dark purple crystals were obtained after washing the residue with cold H2O and EtOH. The crystals were dried in an oven set at 70.0 ℃.</p>
        <h3>Synthesis of Na3[Co(CO3)3]</h3>
          <p>A solution containing 2.910 g of [Co(OH2)6](NO3)2 dissolved in 5.0 cm3 of H2O and 5.0 cm3 of 6% H2O2 solution was added dropwise to a slurry, under constant stirring, containing 4.200 g of NaHCO3 in 10.0 cm3 of H2O in an ice water bath. After 30 min, the dark green suspension was suction filtered. Dark green solids were obtained after washing the residue with H2O and EtOH. The solids were dried in an oven set at 70.0 ℃.</p>
        <h3>Synthesis of N-(2-hydroxybenzyl)-amino acids</h3>
          <p>0.751 g of glycine, 0.891 g of alanine or 1.172 g of valine was added to a solution, under constant stirring, containing 0.562 g of KOH dissolved in 20.0 cm3 of 99.9% EtOH solution and 20.0 cm3 of H2O. 1.062 cm3 of 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde was then added to the solution. After 1 h, 0.454 g of NaBH4 was added to the solution in an ice water bath. After 30 min, glacial acetic acid was added until the pH of the solution was about 6. The solution was left in a refrigerator for 3 days to crystallise and then suction filtered. White crystals were obtained after washing the residue with cold EtOH. The crystals were dried in an oven set at 70.0 ℃.</p>
        <h3>Synthesis of N-(2-pyridylmethyl)-amino acids</h3>
          <p>0.751 g of glycine, 0.891 g of alanine or 1.172 g of valine was added to a solution, under constant stirring, containing 0.562 g of KOH dissolved in 20.0 cm3 of 99.9% EtOH solution and 20.0 cm3 of H2O. 0.952 cm3 of 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde was then added to the solution. After 1 h, 0.454 g of NaBH4 was added to the solution in an ice water bath. After 30 min, glacial acetic acid was added until the pH of the solution was about 6. The solution was then evaporated to dryness and the solid was extracted into hot 99.9% EtOH solution. The solution was left in a refrigerator for 3 days to crystallise and then suction filtered. White crystals were obtained after washing the residue with cold EtOH. The crystals were dried in an oven set at 70.0 ℃.</p>
